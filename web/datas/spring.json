Deciding to save her, he transforms and carries her to safety, but accidentally drops his phone.\n\nThe next day, the girl he saved—Claire Aoki—finds him and confronts him about his monster identity.

With a major geographical foothold in the state of Wei now under its control, Qin sets its sights eastward toward the remaining warring states.\n\nMeanwhile Li Mu—an unparalleled strategist and the newly appointed prime minister of the state of Zhao—has taken advantage of Zhao's temporary truce with Qin to negotiate with the other states without interruption. Seemingly without warning, Ying Zheng receives news that armies from the states of Chu, Zhao, Wei, Han, Yan, and Qi have crossed into Qin territory. Realizing too late the purpose behind Li Mu's truce with Qin, Zheng quickly gathers his advisors to devise a plan to address the six-state coalition army on their doorstep. For the first time in history, the state of Qin faces complete destruction and must use every resource and strategy at their disposal to prevent themselves from being wiped off the map.\n\n[Written by MAL Rewrite]",

This led to the formation of various companies of adventurers who would harvest kirakuri from the dungeons.\n\nFollowing his father's disappearance inside one of the biggest gates in Gatepia, Minato is urged by his childhood friend Yutoria to become the president of his father's treasure-hunting company—the Kibou Company. He reluctantly agrees and meets with the other employees: the priest Makoto, the soldier Akari, and the accountant Guide.\n\nThus, Makoto begins his tenure as president. As he and his comrades strive to fulfill various missions and other assorted tasks in order to keep their small company alive, they will uncover the mystery behind their former leader's sudden departure.\n\n[Written by MAL Rewrite]",

They used to play catch together whenever possible, and in doing so, Yomi discovered her talent for throwing the ball in a way that seemed like magic. The girls promised to keep playing baseball even when they are older and were separated soon after. In the years that followed, Tamaki went on to become a skilled catcher, but Yomi did not get very far despite her throwing prowess.\n\nDeciding to quit her passion, Yomi starts her first year at Shin Koshigaya High School. Try as she might to avoid anything related to baseball, she meets the twins Yoshino and Ibuki Kawaguchi, both of whom are enthusiasts of the sport. Moreover, she stumbles upon Tamaki, and just like old times, they decide to play catch—reigniting Yomi’s desire to pitch.\n\nReunited, Yomi and Tamaki set out to fulfill their childhood promise. Alongside Yoshino and Ibuki, they strive to revive their school’s baseball team which has been on hiatus. More members join until their group is complete, and now the new goal of Shin Koshigaya's girls' baseball team is nothing less than winning the national championships.\n\n[Written by MAL Rewrite]",
