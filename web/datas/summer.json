Angry at her client's disrespect towards her, Chizuru reveals her true nature: sassy and temperamental, the complete opposite of Kazuya's first impression. At that very moment, Kazuya receives news of his grandmother's collapse and is forced to bring Chizuru along with him to the hospital.\n \nAlthough it turns out to be nothing serious, his grandmother is ecstatic that Kazuya has finally found a serious girlfriend, which had always been her wish. Unable to tell her the truth, Kazuya and Chizuru are forced into a fake relationship—acting as if they are truly lovers.\n \n[Written by MAL Rewrite]",

I thought that was an unattainable dream...\n\nOn an island off the coast of Okinawa, two young men meet on a beach. Shun Hashimoto is gay and aspires to be a novelist. He is interested in Mio Chibana, a somber high school student, and starts to flirt with him. Day by day, the two of them grow closer, but then, suddenly, Mio decides to leave the island.\n\nThree years later, Mio returns and approaches Shun with the words, \"I've thought about it for the past three years. I like you, Shun, even if you're a guy.\" However, when faced with the prospect of finally becoming lovers with Mio, Shun cannot take the first step towards commitment. This is a tantalizing love story about a gay novelist and a younger part-time worker. \n\n(Source: Renta!, edited)",

Using the Ξ Gundam Mafty attempts to attack a meeting of high-ranking Federation cabinet members in Adelaide, Australia to force them to vote down a provision which would strengthen the Federations already considerable powers.\n \nAs a point to note, this novel focuses on a version of events chronicled in creator Yoshiyuki Tomino's novelized form of Char's Counterattack, rather than his animated movie version, and as such, several discrepancies can be found between the animated work and this novel, making it more of a semi-canonical UC storyline, rather than 100% official canon.\n \n(Source: Wikipedia)",
